RasoiMate : Cook Smarter, Waste Less ,Share More

Problem Statement

Every day, large quantities of edible food are wasted in restaurants, hostels, canteens, and households due to poor inventory tracking, lack of awareness on food reuse, and absence of structured donation channels. At the same time, many shelters, NGOs, and underprivileged communities face chronic food shortages. This mismatch highlights the urgent need for a smart, centralized system that bridges the gap between surplus and scarcity.

-->RasoiMate is designed to solve this problem by providing an all-in-one web-based platform that:

-->Tracks and manages food items with expiry alerts,

-->Suggests smart recipes to utilize leftovers efficiently,

-->Connects users to nearby shelters or food banks for seamless food donation.


By empowering users and organizations to make smarter food decisions, RasoiMate promotes sustainability, minimizes food waste, and fosters a culture of sharing and community care.
